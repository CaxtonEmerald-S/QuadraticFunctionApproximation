# QuadraticFunctionApproximation
Approximating Quadratic Function over the interval [0, 1] with single hidden layered neural networks with neurons in hidden layers ranging from 1 to 10. The functional transformations are visualised using the NNVisualiser Framework. The flow plots of each neuron of ten networks are saved here in this repository.
